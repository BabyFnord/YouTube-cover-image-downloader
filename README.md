# Purpose
Downloads and converts images to the current working directory. Maybe useful for presentations â€¦

# Requirements 
- Downloading requires a working `yt-dlp` installation. 
- Conversion requires a working [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) installation for the "convert" command.

# nota bene
Converted images are sequentially renamed "Thumb_xxx.jpg", so check their filenames accordingly.
